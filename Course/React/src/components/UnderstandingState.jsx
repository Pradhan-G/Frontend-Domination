// To understand State we need to use react hooks.
// useState is a hook that allows us to create a state.
// How to use useState hook ?
// 1. Import useState from react
// 2. Create a state variable
// 3. Pass the variable to the component
// 4. Use the variable in the component
// 5. Update the state variable
// 6. the useState hook returns an array.
// The first element of the array is the state variable.
// The second element of the array is a function that allows us to update the state variable which should be a function.
// const [name, setName] = useState("John");
// const [age, setAge] = useState(30);
// here name and age are the state variables and setName and setAge are the functions that allow us to update the state variables.
